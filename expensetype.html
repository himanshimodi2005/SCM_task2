        <td>
            A flexible expense is a discretionary purchase that can be altered or eliminated without a significant downside. Flexible expenses include things like entertainment, toys, hobby supplies, alcohol, tobacco and any new unnecessary items like clothing or shoes.

    <tr>
        <td>
            Fixed Expenses
        </td>
        <td>
            A fixed expense is a cost that's typically constant. Fixed expenses are paid at regular intervals—often monthly. Some fixed expenses are what are known as “periodic fixed expenses.” 
        </td>

    <tr>
        <td>
            Variable Expenses
        </td>
        <td>
            Variable expenses are those that change in cost and occurrence. These expenses are more difficult to plan for, as they can vary depending on several factors, such as unforeseen events and discretionary spending.

            Essential Expenses

            Certain expenses, though, must be paid to keep things running, such as housing costs, taxes, and health insurance for individuals and payroll, warehousing costs, and transport for businesses.
